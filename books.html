    <h1>My favourite books</h1>
    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Here are my top three favorite books.Each one offers a unique story, valuable lessons, and unforgettable characters.</p>
    <h3>The Alchemist</h3>
    <p>The Alchemist follows Santiago, a young shepherd boy from Andalusia, who dreams of discovering a hidden treasure located near the Egyptian pyramids. Motivated by his recurring dream, he embarks on a journey that takes him across deserts and foreign lands, meeting various people who guide him along the way.
        During his journey, Santiago encounters a king named Melchizedek, who introduces him to the concept of a Personal Legend — the idea that everyone has a unique destiny they must fulfill. He also meets an Englishman seeking the secrets of alchemy and a wise alchemist who helps him understand the deeper meaning of life and the importance of listening to his heart.
        Santiago faces numerous challenges, including fear, doubt, and setbacks, but he learns that the universe conspires to help those who pursue their true calling. He discovers that the treasure he seeks is not just material wealth but the wisdom and self-discovery gained through the journey itself
        The novel explores themes of faith, destiny, and self-discovery. It teaches that true happiness comes from following one’s heart and recognizing the signs that life presents along the way. Santiago's transformation from an ordinary shepherd to a confident individual who understands his purpose reflects the idea that the journey itself is more valuable than the destination.
        Coelho's simple yet profound writing style makes The Alchemist a timeless and inspirational read. It encourages readers to trust their instincts, embrace change, and believe that their dreams are achievable if they stay committed to their path.</p>
    <h3>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</h3>
    <p>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone introduces Harry Potter, an orphaned boy who has grown up in the unkind care of his Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon Dursley, along with their spoiled son Dudley. On his eleventh birthday, Harry learns that he is not an ordinary boy — he is a wizard and has been accepted into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
        At Hogwarts, Harry quickly befriends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, forming a strong bond that becomes the foundation of his new life.

As the school year progresses, Harry, Ron, and Hermione uncover the mystery of the Sorcerer’s Stone — a magical object capable of granting immortality.

        Facing magical traps and challenges, the trio works together to stop Voldemort. Harry ultimately comes face-to-face with the dark wizard, hidden in the body of Professor Quirrell. With courage and the power of love — the protection his mother gave him — Harry defeats Quirrell and prevents Voldemort from regaining strength</p>
    <h3>Atomic Habits</h3>
    <p>Atomic Habits by James Clear is a transformative self-help book that explores the science of habit formation and how small, consistent changes can lead to remarkable long-term results. Clear argues that success doesn’t come from drastic changes but from the accumulation of small improvements over time — what he calls the 1% rule. By improving just 1% each day, you can experience exponential growth and transformation over time.
        Clear explains that habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Just as money grows through compound interest, small daily improvements build up over time to create significant personal growth. He also highlights the importance of focusing on systems rather than goals — successful people focus on building effective systems that lead to success rather than just setting goals.
        it’s a practical framework for transforming your life by focusing on small, meaningful changes. It teaches that success is not about massive transformations but about building better habits through consistency, positive reinforcement, and identity-based change.
